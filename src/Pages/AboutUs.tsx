              Unlike traditional IT consultancies that rely on subpar talent,
              leading to buggy, delayed, and over-budget projects, we take a
              different approach. We believe AI is amplifying individual impact
              to an unprecedented degreeâ€”enabling elite engineers to build
              high-quality solutions directly for businesses while earning at
              par with Big Tech.

          Our mission is to leverage AI and top-tier engineering talent to
          deliver IT solutions that are faster, more cost-effective, and far
          superior in quality. If you are looking for 10x engineers to build
